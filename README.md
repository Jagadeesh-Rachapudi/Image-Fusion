# Image Fusion Using Wavelet Transform

This repository contains Python scripts for fusing images of cars and bolts respectively. The fusion process utilizes the wavelet transform technique. 

## Files

1. `Fuse_Car.py`: This script is used for fusing images of cars.
2. `Fuse_Bolt.py`: This script is used for fusing images of bolts.

## Usage

1. Place the input images you want to fuse in the same folder as the scripts.
2. Run the appropriate script (`Fuse_Car.py` for car images and `Fuse_Bolt.py` for bolt images).
3. Follow the instructions or adjust parameters within the script as needed.
4. The fused image will be saved in the same folder as the input images.

## Credits

The implementation of image fusion using wavelet transform in Python is based on the guidance and code provided in the following Stack Overflow thread:
